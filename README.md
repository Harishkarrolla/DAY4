SUM
SUM is an aggregate function in SQL that calculates the total sum of a numeric column for a set of rows.
It is often used with GROUP BY to find totals for each group or without it to compute the total for the entire table.

COUNT
COUNT is an SQL function that returns the number of rows that match a specified condition or in a dataset.
It can count all rows using COUNT(*) or count only non-null values in a specific column.

AVG
AVG is an aggregate function in SQL that computes the average (mean) of numeric values in a specified column.
It ignores NULL values and is commonly used to calculate averages within groups using GROUP BY or across the whole table.

GROUP BY
GROUP BY is a clause in SQL that groups rows sharing the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
It is frequently used with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG to generate grouped summaries.
